I am a data analyst from Seattle, now calling Austin home. I live on the Eastside with my wife and our two dogs. I love hiking, snowboarding and have a blue belt in Jiu Jitsu. When I’m not coding, or problem solving, you’ll find me in the kitchen, cooking and or eating but probably more of the latter.

I have also:

- Built a steel string acoustic guitar by hand from scratch
- Owned a 1972 FJ40 Land Cruiser
- Eaten hákarl (rotten shark) in Iceland and didn't vomit
- Mostly lost my sense of smell (Actually now that I think about it that’s probably why I didn’t vomit)
